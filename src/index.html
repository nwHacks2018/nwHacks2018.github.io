        <p>Canada ranks among the <a href="https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/publications/reports/compar/compar2016.pdf" target="_blank">most expensive countries</a> for Mobile Data within the G7. Mobile data has become unaffordable for most people.</p>

        <h1 class="title is-1 is-spaced">The Solution</h1>
        <p>The application allows for automatic Wifi management. When the user connects to an open network through the application, the credentials and GPS location are stored online and shared across all users of the same app. Any subsequent user with the application will automatically connect to the original open network within range. This creates a crowdsourced set of open Wifi networks.</p>

        <h1 class="title is-3 is-spaced pt-3">The System and Technologies</h3>
        <p>The application is built in Android and uses <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a> as the database to store Wifi networks.</p>
