## Software Stack

| Purpose | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| Content Development | HTML, CSS |
| Styling Framework | [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) |
| Package Manager | [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) |
| Module Bundler | [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

## Setup

First, install [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/).

Clone the repository:
```console
git clone https://github.com/nwHacks2018/nwHacks2018.github.io.git
```

The HTML files and `res/` directory in the root directory are generated by Webpack and the deployment process; do not make any direct changes to these files.

The source files are in the `src/` directory.

Enter the directory:
```console
cd nwHacks2018.github.io/
```

Install the relevant dependencies:
```console
npm install
```

Build the HTML, CSS, SCSS, and JavaScript files into a bundle using Webpack:
```console
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist/` directory. Re-run the build command anytime the styling is modified.

View the page by opening the file `dist/index.html` in a browser.

## Deployment (GitHub Pages)

After building a release candidate (see **Setup** above), make a copy of the built files in `dist/` to the home directory:
```console
npm run deploy
```

This will be published in GitHub Pages upon the next push.
